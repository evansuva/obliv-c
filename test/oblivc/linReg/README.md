# Linear-Regression
Secure MPC version of linear regression function currently in development; C code is based off of [this](https://www.github.com/samuelhavron/linear-regression) repository. Party 1 supplies independent ([x](testx.dat)) data points; party 2 supplies dependent ([y](testy.dat)) data points. Code currently is able to compute secure MPC linear-regression for slope (m) and y-intercept (b); correlation value is yet to be implemented.
