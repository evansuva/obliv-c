# Linear-Regression
Secure MPC version of linear regression function; C code is based off of [this](https://www.github.com/samuelhavron/linear-regression) repository. Party 1 supplies independent ([x](testx.dat)) data points; party 2 supplies dependent ([y](testy.dat)) data points. Runtime information and code optimizations currently in development.

# Usage Notes
Code currently not functional due to movement from stack memory allocation to heap allocation. Will not run successfully as of this commit.
